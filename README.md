This project was completed as part of my internship at Outrix, where I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, machine learning, and deployment of data science projects.

Objective

Analyze students’ performance using data visualization and statistical analysis.

Identify key factors affecting academic results.

Build a predictive model to forecast students’ grades based on input features.

Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Programming language for data analysis and modeling.

Pandas – Data manipulation and preprocessing.

NumPy – Numerical operations and array handling.

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization (bar charts, histograms, heatmaps).



Scikit-learn – Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.

Techniques used:  Random Forest classifier



Key Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions of scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.

Analyze correlations between features and grades.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables (like gender, parental education).

Scale numerical features if required.

Predictive Modeling:

Build machine learning models to predict final grades.

Evaluated for classification.

Insights & Recommendations:

Identify which factors most influence student performance.



Dataset
